# Modular-Programming-with-Python


About the Code Samples
----------------------

These code samples all comes from the book [Modular Progarmming with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/modular-programming-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=9781785884481).
They are organized by chapter.  Please feel free to copy and use these in
whatever way you like -- there are no restrictions at all on the use of these
code samples.

These code samples will work on any Mac OS X, Windows or Linux computer.  While
 they are all written to use Python version 3.3 or later, you can modify them to
use Python 2.x with minimal changes.

To run the code samples from Chapter 4, you will need to install [Reportlab](http://www.reportlab.com/opensource/) and [Pillow](http://python-pillow.org/). To use the "wrappers" example from Chapter 5, you will need to install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/).
All the other examples only require the Python Standard Library.
